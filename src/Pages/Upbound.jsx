              In Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop I designed this online audio
              and beat store, including desktop and mobile versions of the page,
              check out and content management systems. The aim was to create a
              store that felt more premium and curated than existing platforms.
              Another unique selling point was the precise filter that enables
              customers to filter compositions down to the very specifics such
              as mood and artist influence. The main welcome page was
              compartmentalised into a red area for hip hop beats, a blue area
              for background audio and a yellow area for custom requests.

              With two friends I started working on the development of the
              platform, me working on and testing interface prototypes while the
              others worked mostly on the back end including a CMS, license pdf
              generator, mailing system, checkout and payment gateway as well as
              custom waveform generator. This being my first UI project, it
              taught me important lessons about considering feedback,
              responsibility and spacing - many of these considerations only
              became clear when I started coordinating the development with my
              friends and they asked questions about higher resolution
              prototypes I hadn't even thought of.

              I also filmed and edited a video trailer for the concept store and
              created templates for branded social content.
