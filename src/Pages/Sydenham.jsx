            During the summer of 2015, i spent 6 weeks with my uncle in
            Manhattan and with friends in Richmond, VA. Days and evenings I was
            wondering around the city on my own, taking pictures as I went -
            often trying to hide my chunky DSLR camera in an attempt to seem
            more local. I returned to Germany a slightly changed person, having
            really left my home bubble for the first time.
