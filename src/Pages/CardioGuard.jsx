                  In a competitor analysis we focused primarily on design traits
                  instead of business aspects or gaps in the market. Third party
                  apps often did not seem very trustworthy both in the method of
                  measurement as well as in presentation and design. Another
                  issue we found with apps like Apple’s “Health” was that they
                  showed too many values or included too many different health
                  aspects so they lost transparency and clarity in UX. From all

                <p className="bigP">
                  Health tracking and health-related content on the internet can
                  be intimidating and overburdening. Ironically, stess and
                  anxiety have adverse effects on cardiac health. Therefore the
                  app should display only actionable information in a manor that
                  is not anxiety-inducing where it doesn’t need to be.

                  CardioGuard to her. She has some experience using smartphones

                  Together we created flow charts to structure the applications

                  started with hand sketches to get a feel for available space

                  would still remain regular as long as no changes in condition
                  were detected. We also added a little animation of a doctor
                  mannequin to make the app friendlier and provide a character
