            Vourtex is a DJ project started by my friends Evan, Gino, Willi and
            me 2017 in Berlin. Over the years we’ve played in varying formations
            out of the four of us in venues such as Corsica Studios (London),
            ://about blank (Berlin), The Cause (London), Humboldhain (Berlin)
            and Panke Culture (Berlin) in addition to private parties,
            university events and our own{" "}

          </p>
          <p className="bigP">
            Aside from djing, we’ve produced output such as remixes and edits,
            live visuals, light shows, <Link to="/dj/sets">showcase sets</Link>,
            and curated playlists. Musically, our focus is techno, but we’ve
            never been limited to the genre, wandering through trap hiphop, RnB,
            afro house and other electronic styles depending on the venue and
            the mood of the party. We are always balancing on a knives edge
            between recognisable mainstream and exciting underground sounds.
          </p>
          <p className="bigP">
            The goal we set for ourselves back in 2017 remains widely unchanged:
            “In combination of sound with visual elements, unique venues and
            environments, dynamic processes, detailed management, and innovative
            marketing, the Vourtex crew seeks to provide each attendee with the
            best possible experience and advance the party/club culture by
            exploring new means of mixing, producing, and framing music while
            guiding group energy.”
