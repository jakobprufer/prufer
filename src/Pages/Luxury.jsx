              Why does a customer pick a £100.000 watch that indicates time and
              date over a £100 pound watch that additionally includes a
              stopwatch, a timer and alarm function? Why do we crave luxury
              objects that are far detached from our basic needs and whose cost
              is so far detached from their utility? I posed the question about
              the watches to my younger nephew and as children so often do, he
              intuitively hit the nail on its head: “to show off!”. Humans
              consume not just to satisfy their needs, but to signal their

              One implication of this is that primitive instincts still guide

              status, acquiring a mate, keeping a mate, and caring for family,

              that mating-related motivations continue to be incredibly powerful
              motivators for us. That’s because the drive for reproduction is
              ingrained in our brains as a necessity for evolutionary success.
              Similarly, because cooperation is the foundation of our species
              advance, we have a strong desire for social belonging and
              prestige. The combination of competition and cooperation has led
              us to organise in complex hierarchical systems, which I will come
              back to in order to explain luxury consumption.

              Just imagine an office worker’s Friday, a train commute to the
              city, a lunch break and a night out at the pub. Visualise the
              amount of people this worker passes throughout the day compared to
              a hunter gatherer and compare the number of options and activities
              presented to the worker compared to a fairly restricted life a
              stone age human would have led.

              Adapting to this complexity, culture and smaller guidance systems
              have evolved, simplifying the world to meet our limited processing
              capacities. Like traffic rules and road signs govern driving, we
              are channelled through everyday life with little wiggle room, with
              many choices taken away from us by the system. For the office
              worker, his work hours and train schedule limit his commute
              options, company policy determines his tasks and goals for the
              day, his habits and the offerings of a nearby café guide his
              choice of lunch, a social hierarchy and conventions within his
              peer group help deciding on a pub and drink. Correspondingly to
              this concept, division of labour has played an integral part of
              our progress since the days of hunter gatherers. Complex processes
              have been broken up into small, manageable tasks that can be
              completed with an individual’s mental processing capacity. And
              humans put their children through a long education process to
              teach them about culture, guidance systems and specialised tasks,
              in many cases more than 20 years of their life. This means we are
              conditioned to function in our system and responses to our
              environment are widely automatic.

              life we have acquired the ability to infer status, roles and
              prestige of someone, without the necessity for direct acts of
              dominance and aggression. Specific signposts, including the goods
              someone owns, facilitate such evaluations. Going about his
              business in the city, those help the office worker to assess
              whether strangers pose a threat or an opportunity, whether they
              should be respected or dismissed, copied or avoided, whether they
              are potential high-quality mates or not. This is where goods such
              as a £100.000 watch come in. More than just the time, they give
              indication about a person’s quality and identity. Signalling value

              , consuming as a form of self-realisation. Thorstein Veblen has
              coined the concept of conspicuous consumption, which happens when
              goods are purchased not for their practical value, but to signal
              one’s wealth

              . As Veblen describes it, this kind of consumption has become a
              lot more common and accessible for the broad masses after the
              industrial revolution, as an emerging middle class had more money
              to spend than necessities required.

              For a good to be meaningful as a signal, it can’t be easily
              available and needs to come at a considerable cost, which is

              . That explains why people are happy to spend an amount of money
              on luxury items: it signals they have an excess of resources so
              they can be “wasteful” with their spending. The value of such
              signal can outweigh negative utility of the product. This is
              comparable to the train of the peacock, which is hindering for
              survival, but highly valuable as a signal to attract mates. A
              credible signal also shouldn’t be easy to fake. And social systems
              make sure that signals are mostly accurate representations of real
              quality. It is for a reason that wearing fake designer clothing is
              looked down upon and rappers in their lyrics ridicule those that
              rent expensive cars to seem richer than they are.

              describes, we constantly categorise us and others into ingroups
              and outgroups. Consumption also is a means to signal membership to
              a group. Examples could be jerseys to signal association with a
              sports club, but also the newest MacBook to identify oneself as an
              Apple user or a Yacht to fit in with an exclusive friend group.

              You might be reading this and conclude that spending vast sums on
              luxury might be important for some people, but not for you; that
              you don’t mean to show anything with your purchases. But
              signalling consumption can take all kinds of forms. The purchase
              of eco-friendly or pro-social goods for instance can also convey a
              message. And finally, there is the phenomenon of
              countersignalling, which is the opposite of conspicuous
              consumption. Like a CEO that wears jeans and t-shirt instead of a
              suit or upper-class members that despise flashy designer clothing,
              one hereby communicates that the own status, role and prestige is
              so solidified that no goods are required to signal it.
