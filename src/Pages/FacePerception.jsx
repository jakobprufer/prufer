              Graded first (74%), this is my BSc dissertation project at the
              London School of Economics and Behavioural Science. I decided to
              focus on face perception. My supervisor, Deema Awad, had
              introduced me to the gaze cueing effect – our innate tendency to
              detect visual targets quicker if we perceive someone else already
              looking in their direction. This phenomenon tied in with my
              interest in the evolutionary foundation of our cognition.
              Specifically, I investigated whether facial attractiveness affects
              the gaze cueing effect – a feasible hypothesis, as attractive
              faces have been found to exceedingly attract and hold attention.

              I designed and conducted a quantitative online study with 52
              participants using the Gorilla experiment builder for the timed
              reaction tasks. The research was preregistered and underwent
              university ethics approval. I then performed data cleaning,
              preliminary and main ANOVA analysis using the statistical
              programming language R in RStudio.
